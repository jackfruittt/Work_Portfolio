\subsection{Mechanical/Mechatronic Work}

\subsubsection{MDFS Robot for Warman Challenge:}

\textbf{Subject: } Mechanical Design Fundamentals Studio 1 (Spring 2023) \newline
\textbf{Grade Achieved: } Distinction \newline
\textbf{Project Overview: }
The goal of the assignment was to design an autonomous robot [~\ref{fig:beepboop}] in teams. The robot would traverse a track to collect tennis balls and deposit them into a Silo [~\ref{fig:render}]. The final robot my team produced was successful in making the leaderboard.
Below are my contributions to the final design of the project:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Full electrical design [~\ref{fig:sheet1}] [~\ref{fig:sheet2}] with safety features fuses and properly rated components
    \item Custom designed 3D printed TPU Wheels [~\ref{fig:wheel}]
    \item Chassis design and calculations
    \item Parrallel Manipulator design 
    \item Software design and implementation
    \item Construction of the robot
\end{itemize}
