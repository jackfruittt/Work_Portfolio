\subsubsection{MDFS Robot for Warman Challenge:}

\textbf{Subject: } Mechhanical Design Fundamentals Studie 1 (Spring 2023) \newline
\textbf{Grade Achieved: } Distinction \newline
\textbf{Project Overview: }
The goal of the assignment was to design an autonomous robot [~\ref{fig:beepboop}] that could traverse a track to collect tennis balls and deposit them into a Silo [~\ref{fig:render}]. The final robot my team produced was successful in making the leaderboard.
Below are my contributions to the final design of the project:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Full electrical design [~\ref{fig:sheet1}] [~\ref{fig:sheet2}] with safety features fuses and properly rated components
    \item Custom designed 3D printed TPU Wheels [~\ref{fig:wheel}]
    \item Chassis design and calculations
    \item Parrallel Manipulator design 
    \item Software design and implementation
    \item Construction of the robot
\end{itemize}

Whilst this looks like I did everything, it's important to clarify that my group did contribute to different designs for various sub-systems however, the sub-systems didn't integrate together well and we had two members 
(it was a five person group including myself) not contribute for the semester. Because a last minute redesign
was needed we agreed as a team that I would take over the entire design of the robot given my experience and they would focus on the group documentation and the presentation which was a large component along with the robot. Without their efforts in this, I would
not have achieved the grade I did.
