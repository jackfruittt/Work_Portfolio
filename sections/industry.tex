\section{RIMA1 and RIMA2: Conditianal Assessment Robotic Tools for Sewer Pipes}

\label{sec:industry}

\textbf{Brief: } RIMA1 [~\ref{fig:rima1}] and RIMA2 [~\ref{fig:rima2}] are two robotic tools developed by the UTS Robotics Institute in collaboration with Sydney Water. They are designed to conditially assess the pipe walls of sewer 
pipes using Pulse Eddy Current (PEC) Sensors. Both robots operate in the ROS1 framework and are equipped with various sensors and cameras such as IMU and RGB-D cameras. Both robots communicate with the base station using VDSL via a 
kevlar braided cable. The subsections will go over more specific tasks I did on RIMA1 and RIMA2 meaning it will excluide things such as general maintenance and repair which was definitely done given these robtots are prototypes.
