\section{Other Work}
\label{sec:other_work}

\textbf{Brief: } This section will go over the other work I have done outside of my degree in my own time. 

\subsection{Object Detection using YOLOv3, OpenCV and Python:}
This is a simple (not really) demonstration of Object Detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV with Python on an esp32 S3 microcontroller. The code can be found \href{https://github.com/jackfruittt/simple-object-detection}{here}.

\subsection{Random things with an Intel RealSense camera:}

Having worked for the UTS Robotics Institute, I got to play with some pretty cool things. One of which was an RGB-D camera. With it, I did 3D Point Cloud Genearation and Mapping
in ROS melodic using the demo packages and AR tag detection using the realsense pipeline in MATLAB.

\subsection{Rust Learnings:}

I'm current learning Rust out of interest because I belive it's a language with a lot of potential in robotics, including projects based in ROS. All of my Rust Learnings
are documented in this \href{https://github.com/jackfruittt/rust_learnings}{repo}. I want to grow my Rust skills in both high and low level programming for robotics and robotic
applications.
