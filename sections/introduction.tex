This is my portfolio showcasing many projects I have completed via work experience or coursework throughout my degree which I'm expected to complete by end of 2026. 
This entire protfolio is written in LaTeX because it's far superior to word (except formatting.. that sucks). You can find the codebase for this 
portolio \href{https://github.com/jackfruittt/Work_Portfolio}{here}. I've tried to keep this portfolio as brief as possible so you don't have to end 
up reading too many pages. If what I've done seems of interest you're more than welcome to contact me using the contact details on the title page and 
check out my LinkedIn and GitHub. \newline
