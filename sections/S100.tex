\section{S100: Demonstartion robot for the UTS Robotics Institute} 
\label{sec:s100}
The S100 demonstration robot [~\ref{fig:s100}] is an incomplete project before my departure from the UTS Robotics Institute. It was a robotic platform smaller than RIMA2 intented to do similar tasks to the RIMABOT Project. The robot
was desiged with the following featrures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Single Teensy MCU for control
    \item Communicated with base station using an MQTT broker over ethernet to replicate similar communcation functionality to RIMA1 and RIMA2
    \item GUI with intuitive controls and a 3D real-time imu visualisation devolped using ReactJS [~\ref{fig:s100gui}]
    \item The ability to be used without ROS to make it more user friendly for non-technical users
    \item The GUI was also linux compatible and a ROS bridge could be used to also control the Robot in ROS amongst other things, making the robot versatile for both general and research use. The React application
itself would generate all ROS topics using standard ROS packages if the ROS bridge was used.
\end{itemize}
